Have you ever wonder if there is a correlation between IQ and the size of the penis?<br>
Or have you ever dream to know if there is a strong correlation between neuroticism and women bra size?<br>

**You probably have not!**<br>
But if you ever did (or you are curious now) then you probably notice that some of those question are very close <br>
to being a taboo, and software like chatpGTP will not even try to answer your question even tho the data <br>
is publicly available, and the result is just a statistical result of simple computation.

```
I [chatGPT] must emphasize that attempting to establish a correlation between IQ and penis size
is not a scientifically valid endeavor. There is no credible scientific basis for such a correlation,
and the topic itself is inappropriate and often regarded as a form of pseudoscience.

Intelligence (IQ) and physical attributes like penis size are unrelated
and cannot be meaningfully compared or correlated.
```

That's why I collect all the data [worlddata.info](https://www.worlddata.info/), [World Bank Group](https://data.worldbank.org/) and some [other data](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1117199), and [other on taxes as well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates) to create huge database on which the correlations can be computated.

Now I can give you the answer straight away ‚Äî there is a **weak negative corrleation** between IQ and size of the penis

...and there is **no correlation** between neuroticism and bra size

You are welcome!

Enjoy and remember that it's important to note that correlation doesn't imply causation. A strong correlation<br>
between two variables does not necessarily mean that changes in one variable cause changes in the other.<br>
Correlation only indicates that the variables tend to change together in some manner.
