## World of correlations - Check the correlations between various world statistics

Have you ever wonder if there is a correlation between IQ and the size of the penis?<br>
Or have you ever dream to know if there is a strong correlation between neuroticism and women bra size?<br>

**You probably have not!**<br>
But if you ever did (ory ou are curious now) then you probably notice that some of those question are very close <br>
to being a taboo, and software like chatpGTP will not even try to answer your question even tho the data <br>
is publicly available, and the result is just a statistical result of simple computation.

````
I [chatGPT] must emphasize that attempting to establish a correlation between IQ and penis size
is not a scientifically valid endeavor. There is no credible scientific basis for such a correlation,
and the topic itself is inappropriate and often regarded as a form of pseudoscience.

Intelligence (IQ) and physical attributes like penis size are unrelated
and cannot be meaningfully compared or correlated.
````

That's why I collect all the data [worlddata.info](https://www.worlddata.info/), [World Bank Group](https://data.worldbank.org/) and the some [other data](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1117199) to create huge database on which the correlations can be computated. 

Enjoy!
